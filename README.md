### Hi, Terry here 👋 👨🏾‍💻

My interest in technology was born form the desire make a difference by solving problems with people and relationships in mind.

Before my quest to become a developer I have worked in technical and creative positions:

- Business owner
- Project manager - Gaming start up
- Music producer and presenter - BBC / Sony Music / Universal / Virgin
- Technical Officer (Signals) - London Underground

I'm excited by the future of voice command technology, space exploration and automation.

Feel free to contact me in regards to learning how to code, tech, business and all things FAC
