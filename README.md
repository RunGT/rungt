### Hi there I'm Glenroy-Terence, also know as TerryðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m currently working with Founders and Coders to become a rounded full stack developer. My interest in technology was born form the diesire make a difference by solving problems with people and relationships in mind.

Before my quest to become a developer I have worked in technical and creative posistions:
- Technical Officer (Singals) - London Underground
- Music producer and presenter - BBC / Sony Music / Universal / Virgin
- Project manager - Gaming start up
- Business owner - Glenroy's


I'm excited by the future of voice command technology, space exploration and automation. I believe this tech will allow us a humans the time to realign focus
