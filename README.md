# Hey, I’m Glenroy-Terence 👋🏾

I’m a front-end product engineer who enjoys building clean, thoughtful interfaces that feel good to use. My background spans music tech, public platforms, and creative teams. The common thread has always been making digital products that actually help people.

I care about the details, the bigger picture, and how everything fits together. I'm especially interested in how design, UX, and product thinking shape the way we build things.

### What I’ve Been Working On

In recent roles I’ve rebuilt front ends, led subscription and checkout improvements, and worked closely with product and design teams to ship features that moved real metrics.

Most of that work lives in private repos, but I'm happy to talk through how it was built and the thinking behind it.

### A Bit About Me

- Learned to code through [Founders & Coders (FAC20)](https://foundersandcoders.com)  
- Interested in meaningful products, clean architecture, and writing code that's built to last  
- Outside of tech: scuba diving, DJ gear hoarding, and homemade hot sauce experiments

### Say Hello

Always open to talking about front-end, UX, product thinking or sharing notes
