### Hi, Terry here 👋 👨🏾‍💻

I’m currently working with Founders and Coders. My interest in technology was born form the desire make a difference by solving problems with people and relationships in mind.

Before my quest to become a developer I have worked in technical and creative positions:

- Technical Officer (Signals) - London Underground
- Music producer and presenter - BBC / Sony Music / Universal / Virgin
- Project manager - Gaming start up
- Business owner - Glenroy's

I'm excited by the future of voice command technology, space exploration and automation.

Feel free to contact me in regards to learning how to code, tech, business and all things FAC
